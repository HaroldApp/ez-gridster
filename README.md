##Config

The demo shows how you can pass in gridsters options as you would expect. In addition
to the well documented options gridster provides, ez-gridster has a few more bells & whistles.

*widgetDirective* [type: string, default: 'ez-gridster-widget']
Allows you to specify a custom directive & template to handle the widgets for a given gridster instance.
